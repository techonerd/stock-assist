## Hacktoberfest Guidelines 📝

- If an issue is not "assigned," you can assume that no one is working on it (may NOT be true). So to be sure, you can ask the following:

  - Can I take this up?
  - Also, mention a rough deadline until which you plan to fix the issue
  - (Optionally) Potential fixes
    DO NOT CREATE a pull request FIRST if someone else is working on it then your efforts might be wasted. Claiming doable and unclaimed issues should be the priority

- Conventional commits in the PR title are a must

- For frontend, while creating a pull request attach a screenshot of the change

- Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
